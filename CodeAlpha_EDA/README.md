## 🔍 Steps Followed

### Step 1: Ask Meaningful Questions
Questions were framed to understand the dataset, such as the relationship between study hours and marks and the presence of missing values.

### Step 2: Explore Data Structure
The dataset structure, variables, and data types were explored using pandas DataFrame methods.

### Step 3: Identify Trends and Patterns
Trends and patterns were identified using statistical measures and visualizations like line charts.

### Step 4: Test Hypotheses
A hypothesis was tested to validate whether increased study hours result in higher marks using correlation and scatter plots.

### Step 5: Detect Data Issues
The dataset was checked for missing values, duplicates, and outliers to identify potential data quality issues.
